{"name":"GeekHouse","tagline":"Exploring the Role of Lawyer as CTO","body":"# \"From Bleak House to Geek House: The Lawyer as CTO\"\r\n\r\nThis symposium, on April 4th at Brooklyn Law School, concludes with a [panel discussion on the role of Lawyer as CTO](http://www.brooklaw.edu/newsandevents/events/2014/04-04-2014.aspx).  This page exists to expedite and support panel preparation. \r\n\r\n# Panelist Prep:\r\n\r\nIn an agile spirit, perhaps this is a good time to open a channel in prep for our upcoming panel discussion at Brooklyn Law School. I've got three questions: \r\n\r\n\r\n1. When can touch base briefly (eg 10 min) before Friday regarding the panel?\r\n\r\n**Schedule me at: [doodle.com/Dazza](http://doodle.com/Dazza)**\r\n\r\n2. What is your preferred bio link? \r\n\r\n**Email me at: dazza@civics.com**\r\n\r\n3. Do you prefer one of these UnPanel methods or wish to propose an alternative?\r\n\r\n**Hit this easy form or email me at: dazza@civics.com**\r\n\r\nA) Panelists-propelled session topics  \r\n- Panelists propose topics Tue/Wed/Thur via webform: proposer name, topic title & 2 sentence description\r\n- Panelists click link on Friday to review and rate proposed topics of others;\r\n- As moderator, I facilitate discussion on the top rated topics (perhaps top 3);\r\n\r\nB) Participant-propelled session topics  \r\n- Symposium registrants are invited by email to propose topics via webform by Thursday;\r\n- Participants AT the conference are provided a method to rate proposals (Twitter +1 or link, etc)\r\n- As moderator, I facilitate discussion proportionally same as above\r\n\r\nC) Hybrid of rating methods above, such as:\r\n- Topics from results of both A and B are selected, and/or\r\n- Participants rate proposals of panelists, and/or \r\n- Panelists rate proposals of participants \r\n\r\nD) Hybrid of physical/digital UnPanel methods, such as: \r\n- We punctuate session for 15 minutes in middle so participants can discuss one of the top 10 topics by walking to a location with a huge sticky note declaring the topic and include resulting ideas/questions as input to panelist discussion;\r\n- We start and end the session as a panel, but spend 80% of time fanning out to catalyze and focus the breakout sessions, then the panelists bring back top ideas/questions at end of session\r\n- We use the \"[MIT Media Lab UnHangout](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/event/Lawyer-CTO)\" tool to allow online breakouts for in-person and/or remote participants and include top ideas/questions as input to panelist discussion\r\n\r\nE) Other?\r\n- Can you suggest another innovative panel format?\r\n\r\n\r\n# Relevant Background Information:\r\n\r\n**Topic:** The Lawyer as “CTO”\r\n\r\n**Time:** April 4th, 4:25 to 5:15\r\n\r\n**Tag:** #brooklawgeek \r\n\r\n**Moderator**\r\n\r\n●      [Daniel \"Dazza\" Greenwood](http://dazzagreenwood.com), Computational Legal Science Group at the MIT Media Lab; Founder, CIVICS.com\r\n\r\n**Panelists**\r\n\r\n●      Andrew McLaughlin, Partner, Betaworks; CEO, Digg and Instapaper; Former White House Deputy CTO \r\n\r\n●      [Beth Noveck](Bio is here - http://thegovlab.org/about/team/beth-simone-noveck), Director, The Governance Lab, and Jacob K. Javits Visiting Professor, NYU; Former White House Deputy CTO\r\n\r\n●      Michael Robak, Associate Library Director and Director of Technologies, University of Missouri – Kansas City School of Law \r\n\r\n●      Steven Berrent, Managing Director, WilmerHale eDiscoverySolutions; Director of Information Technology, Vice President Al Gore’s presidential campaign\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# General Notes\r\n\r\n**Relevant Panel Focus:** \"...current and former White House Deputy Chief Technology Officers and lawyer/technologists explore the role of the lawyer in emerging ventures and tech policy formation\" and **relevant Conference Focus:** \"...new issues facing the legal system, changes in law and legal practice that are needed and are underway, and how the future of law and legal practice might look. In addition to the presentations and talks, this program will also include demonstrations of forward-looking legal products and services exemplifying the new face of law practice...\"\r\n\r\n**Notes regarding \"UnPanel\" Live Engagement:** Instead of generating and rating ideas during the week (especially if nobody gets around to it) we might have fun performing the panelist-propelled process (option A) as a group in front of everybody during, say, the first 10 minutes (ie using your phone/laptops and projected onscreen from my laptop).  It might be engaging and entertaining for panelist and participant alike. Hybrid idea: perhaps save one topic slot (eg 10 minutes-ish) to be generated \"live\" at the top of the session. \r\n\r\n**Notes regarding \"UnPanel\" Followup Engagement:** If panelists are game for an informal follow up, some/all of us could gather on a brief Google Hangout a for registered participants a few weeks hence to address open topics or questions from April 4th and/or to respond to new or iterated input from subsequent larger scale rounds of topic/question/idea generation and ratings. A totally asynchronous way might be to give a period for participants to iterate followup questions or ideas (say 2 weeks) and then a period for panelist feedback on the top rated follow up (say 2 weeks) and then I do a closing wrapup YouTube and blogpost tracking through the results.  (But a closing live Hangout seems better suited, especially if a large number of people participated and felt invested in the followup).  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
