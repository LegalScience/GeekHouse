<p>This symposium, on April 4th at Brooklyn Law School, concludes with a <a href="http://www.brooklaw.edu/newsandevents/events/2014/04-04-2014.aspx">panel discussion on the role of Lawyer as CTO</a>.  This page exists to expedite and support panel preparation. </p>

<a name="panelist-prep" class="anchor" href="#panelist-prep"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Panelist Prep:</h1>

<p>In an agile spirit, perhaps this is a good time to open a channel in prep for our upcoming panel discussion at Brooklyn Law School. I've got three questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>When can we touch base briefly (eg 10 min) before Friday regarding how best to make the panel and your experience wonderful?</li>
</ol><p><strong>Schedule me at: <a href="http://doodle.com/Dazza">doodle.com/Dazza</a></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What is your preferred bio link (and do you want a change to your title on the <a href="http://www.brooklaw.edu/newsandevents/events/2014/%7E/media/88DD1F044EB043C3BDFC29D4302E6152.ashx">agenda</a>)? </li>
</ol><p><strong>Email me at: <a href="mailto:dazza@civics.com">dazza@civics.com</a></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Optional: Do you prefer one of these UnPanel methods or wish to propose an alternative?</li>
</ol><p><strong>Email me at: <a href="mailto:dazza@civics.com">dazza@civics.com</a></strong></p>

<p>Panelists have spoken and we have heard: Don't do presentations.  Do innovate format.  For your panel pleasure, I have therefore invented a new format.  I give you:</p>

<h2>
<a name="the-unpanel" class="anchor" href="#the-unpanel"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The UnPanel!</h2>

<p><strong>Basic Concept</strong>: The simplest expression of this concept is that I ask each of you what you want to talk about at the start of the panel and I emphasize the topics you like most as a group.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Method: Each panelist in turn suggests 2-3 topics which I type on my laptop projected for all to see.  While I'm writing the topic titles, each panelist says a few words on what each topics is about.  Once everybody has contributed, I go through each topic one at a time asking panelists to raise a hand with 1-5 fingers for their rating of each topic. </p></li>
<li><p>Outcome:  I moderate discussion on the top few topics (I'd likely allocate time and prioritize order based on votes, but cross-reference as relevant to multiple other topics throughout the session.  </p></li>
<li><p>Variations: More complex and interesting methods include using a simple webform and rating tool rather than me writing down topics and getting a show of hands, and (upping the stakes from there) allowing panelists and/or registered participants to join the fun by generating and rating topic ideas in the days before Friday.   </p></li>
</ul><p><strong>Advanced Concept</strong>: </p>

<p>A) Panelists-propelled session topics  </p>

<ul>
<li>Panelists propose topics Tue/Wed/Thur via webform: proposer name, topic title &amp; 2 sentence description</li>
<li>Panelists click link on Friday to review and rate proposed topics of others</li>
<li>Moderator facilitates discussion on the top rated topics respectively/proportionally</li>
</ul><p>B) Participant-propelled session topics  </p>

<ul>
<li>Symposium registrants are invited by email to propose topics via webform by Thursday;</li>
<li>Participants AT the conference are provided a method to rate proposals (Twitter +1 or link, etc)</li>
<li>As moderator, I facilitate discussion proportionally same as above</li>
</ul><p>C) Hybrid of rating methods above, such as:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Topics from results of both A and B are selected, and/or<br>
</li>
<li>Participants rate proposals of panelists, and/or<br>
</li>
<li>Panelists rate proposals of participants<br>
</li>
</ul><p>D) Hybrid of physical/digital UnPanel methods, such as:   </p>

<ul>
<li>We punctuate session for 15 minutes in middle so participants can discuss one of the top 10 topics by walking to a location with a huge sticky note declaring the topic and include resulting ideas/questions as input to panelist discussion<br>
</li>
<li>We start and end the session as a panel, but spend 80% of time fanning out to catalyze and focus the breakout sessions, then the panelists bring back top ideas/questions at end of session<br>
</li>
<li>We use the "<a href="https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/event/Lawyer-CTO">MIT Media Lab UnHangout</a>" tool to allow online breakouts for in-person and/or remote participants and include top ideas/questions as input to panelist discussion</li>
</ul><p>E) Other?  </p>

<ul>
<li>Can you suggest another innovative panel format?</li>

<a name="general-notes" class="anchor" href="#general-notes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>General Notes</h1>

<p><strong>Relevant Panel Focus:</strong> "...current and former White House Deputy Chief Technology Officers and lawyer/technologists explore the role of the lawyer in emerging ventures and tech policy formation" and <strong>relevant Conference Focus:</strong> "...new issues facing the legal system, changes in law and legal practice that are needed and are underway, and how the future of law and legal practice might look. In addition to the presentations and talks, this program will also include demonstrations of forward-looking legal products and services exemplifying the new face of law practice..."</p>

<p><strong>Ideas for "UnPanel" Followup Engagement:</strong> If panelists are game for an informal follow up, some/all of us could gather on a brief Google Hangout (public but especially for registered participants) a few weeks hence to address open topics/questions we didn't address fully or at all from April 4th and/or to respond to new or iterated input from subsequent larger scale rounds of topic/question/idea generation and ratings. A more asynchronous way might be to give a period for participants to iterate followup questions or ideas (say 2 weeks) and then a period for panelist feedback on the top rated follow up (say 2 weeks) and then I do a closing wrapup YouTube and blogpost tracking through the results.  (But a closing live Hangout seems better suited, especially if a large number of people participated and felt invested in the followup).  </p>
